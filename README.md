# ツ Subject:
Planning for the post-February 6 earthquake.

# ツ Aim and objectives:

Tried to show on the map the infrastructure and lines we chose (including the resources we obtained) in order to minimize the earthquake and damage that affected our country on February 6th. 

While examining the damaged areas on the map for our assignment, we chose the province of Adıyaman, taking into account the sources of the studies we will do. For this reason, we calculated the proximity to the imaginary assembly area on the map and designed the power plant and treatment facilities.

# ツ Requirements:

• Power (electricity) line

• Water infrastructure

• Transportation line

As a result of research, I felt the need to explain a little bit in our report about the processes they went through to provide electricity and water.

## Electricity Requirement

For the dam, we chose to provide electricity to the earthquake zone from the Atatürk dam, which is the 6th largest dam in the world. At the same time, we will meet the water needs from this dam.

Atatürk Dam Hydroelectric Power Plant uses the flow energy of water to generate electricity. A channel is created from the dam to change the bed of the accumulated water .And through this channel, the water is transferred to the water bed that we have opened for electricity in another way.In order to collect the flowing water, large concrete blocks are built in front of the water and thus the water reaching a certain height has a serious potential energy.The potential energy of the water flowing from the upper levels from hydroelectric power plants is converted into mechanical energy.When the cover of the dam is opened, the water reaches the turbine by passing through the penstock pipes with the effect of gravity. The pressure pipes between the dam lake and the turbines are called penstock pipes. And these pipes allow the water to reach the turbines. Some pipes used help the water to gain a certain acceleration.The water coming into the turbine interacts and converts the motion energy into mechanical energy. The shaft of the turbine is connected to the impeller of the generator engine. The mechanical energy transferred to the generator is converted into electrical energy here.

The electricity line we obtained from the Atatürk dam and supplied to the city from the hydroelectric power plant is shown on the map below;

## Water Requirement

In research, realized that the depth of the waterline is important. The deeper the waterline, the less likely it is to be affected by surface movement during an earthquake. That's why Atatürk Dam was a solid choice.

The map created for the transmission of the water supplied from the Atatürk Dam to the earthquake zone after filtering and necessary procedures at the Kahta Drinking Water Treatment Plant is as follows;

## Transportation

I took into account factors such as the population of the city, the existing transport infrastructure, proximity to the airport and ring road. We considered alternative transportation options in case the infrastructure was damaged or destroyed. Providing the transportation line is a very important need like water and electricity. We tried to create the necessary road line for the transportation of people, materials or equipment to or from the earthquake zone.
